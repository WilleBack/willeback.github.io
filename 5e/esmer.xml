         <title>Booming Blade</title>
         <level>Cantrip</level> <school>evocation</school>
         <casting>1 action</casting>
         <range>5 feet</range>
         <components>V, M (a weapon)</components>
         <duration>1 round</duration>
         
         <section>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the target willingly moves before then, it immediately takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.</section>
         <section>This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for moving increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</section>

         <title>Mending</title>

         <duration>Instantaneous</duration>
         
         <section>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no longer than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</section>
         <section>This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.</section>

         <title>Minor Illusion</title>
         <level>Cantrip</level> <school>illusion</school>
         <casting>1 action</casting>
         <range>30 feet</range>
         <components>S, M (a bit of fleece)</components>
         <duration>1 minute</duration>
         
         <section>You create a sound or image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.</section>
         <section>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</section>
         <section>If you create an image of an object -such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest- it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</section>
         <section>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</section>

         <section>You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage.</section>
         <section>The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</section>

         <section>Choose up to 5 falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.</section>
