         <section>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following effects within range:</section>
         <section style="bullet">You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You instantaneously clear or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You chill, warm, or flavour up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.</section>
         <section>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</section>
