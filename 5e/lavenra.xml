         <section>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following effects within range:</section>
         <section style="bullet">You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You instantaneously clear or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You chill, warm, or flavour up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.</section>
         <section style="bullet">You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.</section>
         <section>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</section>

         <section>As part of the action to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and green fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</section>
         <section>This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</section>

         <section>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</section>
         <section>Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the tarsk to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.</section>
         <section>If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</section>

Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.</section>
