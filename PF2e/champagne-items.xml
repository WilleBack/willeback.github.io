      <line>This item consists of two magically linked rings: an intricate, gleaming golden ring with a square-cut ruby, and a thick, plain iron ring. When you wield a melee weapon in the hand wearing the golden ring, the weapon's fundamental runes (<![CDATA[<i>potency</i> and <i>striking</i>]]>) are replicated onto any melee weapon you wield in the hand wearing the iron ring. Any fundamental runes normally on the weapon in the hand wearing the iron ring are suppressed.</line>
      <line>The replication functions only if you wear both rings, and it ends as a soon as you cease wielding a melee weapon in one of your hands. Consequently, the benefit doesn't apply to thrown attacks or if you're holding a weapon but not wielding it (such as holding in one hand a weapon that requires two hands to wield).</line>
