      <line>You shape a wall of solid stone. You create a 1-inch-thick wall of stone up to 120 feet long, and 20 feet high. You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to sand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or a set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unoccupied space so its endges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost.</line>
      <line>Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 14, and 50 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.</line>

      <heighten value="+2">The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 15.</heighten>
