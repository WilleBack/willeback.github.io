      <line>An <i>instinct crown</i> is a magical headpiece imbued with the essence of instincts that barbarians draw upon in combat.
         Each crown is fashioned to represent the instinct it's tied to, such as a wolf's head for an animal instinct crown or a simple helmet with Jotun runes for a giant instinct crown.
         When worn, the crown allows you to tap further into your instincts, granting you even greater benefits if the crown's essence matches your instinct.
         You must be able to Rage to use the crown's activations.</line>

      <line>Before activation, this item appears to be nothing more than a simple rolled-up tent, barely large enough to fit four Medium creatures.
         Despite attempts to clean it, the tent is perpetually smudged with dirt in various places.</line>

         <part><name>Effect</name>The rolled-up tent expands into a spacious yurt complete with a fire pit, 10 bedrolls, various cooking utensils, and basic food and water.</part>
         <part>The yurt can house and feed you and up to nine other Medium creatures that eat roughly as much as a human does; they need not attempt a Survival check to Subsist when you use the yurt.
            Fires and light inside the yurt do not extend illumination into the area surrounding the yurt, making it harder to spot from a distance.</part>
