      <line>Your ears are finely tuned, able to detect even the slightest whisper of sound. As long as you can hear normally, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures in a 60-foot cone instead of a 30-foot cone.

If precision is necessary, the GM can have you select a 30-foot cone or a 15-foot burst within line of sight. You might take a penalty if you choose an area that's far away.</line>
      <line>If you're using Seek to search for objects (including secret doors and hazards), you search up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you. The GM might determine you need to Seek as an activity, taking more actions or even minutes or hours if you're searching a particularly cluttered area.</line>
      <line>The GM attempts a single secret Perception check for you and compares the result to the Stealth DCs of any undetected or hidden creatures in the area or the DC to detect each object in the area (as determined by the GM or by someone Concealing the Object). A creature you detect might remain hidden, rather than becoming observed, if you're using an imprecise sense (such as hearing) or if an effect (such as an <![CDATA[<i>invisibility</i>]]> spell) prevents it from being observed.</line>

You can cast this cantrip as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heighened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. Since this magic is innate, you can replace any material component with a somatic component.</line>

      <line>The Medicine check DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as treating a patient outside in a storm, or treating magically cursed wounds. If you're an expert in Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 10; if you're a master of Medicine, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 30; and if you're legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to increase the Hit Points regained by 50.

      <title>Primal Spellcasting</title>

      <line>The power of the wild world flows through you. You can cast primal spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a druid, you can usually hold a primal focus (such as holly and mistletoe) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a material component pouch.</line>
      <line>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spells slots.</line>
      <line>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC. Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</line>
      <line><![CDATA[<b>Cantrips</b>]]></line>

      <line>Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</line>
      <line>Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Selecting druid feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</line>

      <line>You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you need to perform are specified in the class or ability that gives you your focus spells. These deeds can usually overlap with other tasks that relate to the source of your focus spells. For instance, a cleric with focus spells from a good deity can usually Refocus while tending the wounds of their allies, and a wizard of the illusionist school might be able to Refocus while attempting to Identify Magic of the illusion school.</line>

      <line>Some spells are cast as a reaction or free action. In those cases, you Cast the Spell as a reaction or free action (as appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases will be noted in the spell's stat block (for example, "<![CDATA[<b>Cast </b> <span style="font-family: 'pfactions'; font-size: 150%; width:2em; text-align: center;">R</span>]]> verbal").</line>
      <line><![CDATA[<b>Long Casting Times </b>]]> Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. The Cast a Spell activity for these spells includes a mix of the listed spell components, but it's not necessary to break down which one you're providing at a given time. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</line>
      <line><![CDATA[<b>Spell Components </b>]]> Each spell lists the spell components required to cast it after the action icons or text, such as "<![CDATA[<span style="font-family: 'pfactions'; font-size: 150%; width:2em; text-align: center;">3</span>]]> material, somatic, verbal". The spell components, described in detail below, add traits (listed in parenthesis) and requirements to the Cast a Spell activity. If you can't provide the components, you fail to Cast the Spell.</line>
      <line list="">
         <entry>Material (manipulate); A material component is a bit of physical matter consumed in the casting of the spell, and requires you to have a free hand to retrieve and manipulate the material component. The component is expended in the casting (even if the spell is disrupted).<![CDATA[<br/>]]>Except in extreme circumstances, you can assume all common components are included in a material component pouch.</entry>
         <entry>Somatic (manipulate); A somatic component is a specific hand movement or gesture that generates a magical nexus. You can use this component while holding something in your hand, but not if you are restrained or otherwise unable to gesture freely.<![CDATA[<br/>]]> Spells that require you to touch the target require a somatic component. You can do so while holding something as long as part of your hand is able to touch the target (even if it's through a glove or gauntlet).</entry>
         <entry>Verbal (concentrate); A verbal component is a vocalization of words of power. You must speak them in a strong voice, so it's hard to conceal that you're Casting a Spell. You must be able to speak to provide this component.</entry>
         <entry>Focus (manipulate); A focus is an object that funnels the magical energy of the spell. The spell requires you to either have a free hand to retrieve the focus listed in the spell or already holding the focus in your hand. As part of Casting the spell, you retrieve the focus (if necessary), manipulate it, and can stow it again if you so choose.<![CDATA[<br/>]]> Foci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to Cast the Spell.</entry>
      </line>
      <line><![CDATA[<b>Disrupted and Lost Spells </b>]]> Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot, spent the spell's costs and actions, and used the Cast a Spell activity. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain a Spell action, the spell immediately ends. See the full rules for more information.</line>
