      <title>Druid Spellcasting</title>

      <line>The power of the wild world flows through you. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic.</line>
      <line>You can prepare spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</line>
      <line>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</line>
      <line name="Heighening Spells">You can fill spell slots of 2nd rank or higher with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</line>
      <line name="Cantrips">Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesnt use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.</line>
   </rule>

   <rule>
      <title>Casting Spells</title>

      <line>Casting a spell requires the caster to make gestures and utter incantations, so being unable to speak prevents spellcasting for most casters.</line>
      <line>Spellcasting creates obvious sensory manifestations, such as bright lights, crackling sounds, and sharp smells from the gathering magic. Nearly all spells manifest a spell signature —a colorful, glowing ring of magical runes that appears in midair, typically around your hands, though what kind of spellcaster you are can affect this— academic wizards typically have neat and ordered signatures, while a druid's might be more organic and a cleric's might be inspired by their deity.</line>
      <line>Spells can vary in how many actions they take. as shown in the spell's stat block. You cast cantrips, spells from spell slots, and focus spells using the same process, but must expend the spell when casting a spell from a spell slot and must spend 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity, such as "if the next action you use it to Cast a Spell." Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity, and any characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spell you're casting.</line>
      <line name="Costs and Loci">Some spells require you to pay a cost or provide a locus. If the spell lists a <b>cost</b>, you must have the listed money, valuable materials, or other resources to cast the spell (such as gems or magical reagents), and they're expended during the casting. A <b>locus</b> is an object that funnels or directs the magical energy of the spell but is not consumed in its casting. As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the locus (if necessary, and if you have a hand free), and you can put it away again if you so choose. Loci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to cast the spell, but they aren't expended like costs are.</line>
      <line name="Long Casting Times"> Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</line>
      <line name="Disrupted and Lost Spells">Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot and spent the spell's costs and actions. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain action, the spell immediately ends.</line>
   </rule>

   <rule>
      <title>Order Spells</title>

      <line>Order spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you have a focus pool of 1 Focus Point for each focus spell you have, to a maximum of 3 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with local nature spirits or otherwise tend to the wilderness in a way befitting your order.</line>
      <line>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots to cast, and you can't cast them using spell slots. You gain the order spell for your druidic order, and certain feats give you more focus spells.</line>

      <line>You reach within for a different part of yourself, and you set it free, transforming your body into another form. You polymorph into any form listed in <i>pest form</i>, which lasts for 10 minutes. All other <i>untamed form</i> shapes last 1 minute.</line>
      <line>You can add more forms to your <i>untamed form</i> list with druid feats; your feat might grant you some or all of the forms from a given <u>polymorph</u> spell. When you transform into a shape granted by a spell, you gain all the effects of the shape you chose from a version of the spell heightened to <i>untamed form</i>'s rank.</line>
      <line><i>Untamed form</i> allows you to use your own shapeshifting training more easily than most <u>polymorph</u> spells. When you choose to use your own attack modifier while polymorphed instead of the form's default attack modifier, you gain a +2 status bonus to your attack rolls.</line>
