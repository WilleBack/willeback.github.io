     <title>Deny Advantage</title>
     <line>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your or lower using Surprise Attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</line>

    <title>Stubborn</title>
    <line>You don't like being told what to do, and you don't give up. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</line>
    <line>When you fail, but don't critically fail, a Will save against an effect that would give you the controlled condition, you can attempt a second save against the effect at the start of your next turn. On a successful second save, the controlled condition ends, though any other effects remain. As normal, failing this second save doesn't allow you to attempt a third save on the subsequent turn.</line>
