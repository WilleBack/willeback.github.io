      <title>Casting Spells</title>

      <line>Casting a spell requires the caster to make gestures and utter incantations, so being unable to speak prevents spellcasting for most casters.</line>
      <line>Spellcasting creates obvious sensory manifestations, such as bright lights, crackling sounds, and sharp smells from the gathering magic. Nearly all spells manifest a spell signature —a colorful, glowing ring of magical runes that appears in midair, typically around your hands, though what kind of spellcaster you are can affect this— academic wizards typically have neat and ordered signatures, while a druid's might be more organic and a cleric's might be inspired by their deity.</line>
      <line>Spells can vary in how many actions they take. as shown in the spell's stat block. You cast cantrips, spells from spell slots, and focus spells using the same process, but must expend the spell when casting a spell from a spell slot and must spend 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity, such as "if the next action you use it to Cast a Spell." Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity, and any characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spell you're casting.</line>
      <line name="Costs and Loci">Some spells require you to pay a cost or provide a locus. If the spell lists a <b>cost</b>, you must have the listed money, valuable materials, or other resources to cast the spell (such as gems or magical reagents), and they're expended during the casting. A <b>locus</b> is an object that funnels or directs the magical energy of the spell but is not consumed in its casting. As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the locus (if necessary, and if you have a hand free), and you can put it away again if you so choose. Loci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to cast the spell, but they aren't expended like costs are.</line>
      <line name="Long Casting Times"> Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted.</line>
      <line name="Disrupted and Lost Spells">Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot and spent the spell's costs and actions. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain action, the spell immediately ends.</line>
