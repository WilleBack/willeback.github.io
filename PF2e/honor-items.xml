      <line>You create an illusion that cause you to appear as another creature of the same body shape, and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself. The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual. The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms. You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress. Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.</line>
      <line>Casting <i>illusory disguise</i> counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties the target might take for disguising itself as a dissimilar creature, gives a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise, and lets the target add its level to such Deception checks even if untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.</line>

      <line>Though it appears to be a cloth bag decorated with panels of richly colored silk or stylish embroidery, a <i>spacious pouch</i> opens into a magical space larger than its outside dimensions. The Bulk held inside the bag doesn't change the Bulk of the <i>spacious pouch</i> itself. The amount of Bulk the pouch's extradimensional space can hold depends on its type. You can Interact with the <i>spacious pouch</i> to stow items in it or remove them just like a mundane sack. Though the bag can hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside.</line>
      <line>If the bag is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it's turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed, but the pouch must be put right beofre it can be used again. A living creature placed inside the pouch has enough air for 10 minutes before it begins to suffocate, and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An item inisde the pouch provides no benefits unless it's retrieved first. An item in the pouch can't be detected by magic that detects only things on the same plane.</line>

      <line><i>gate attenuators</i> are typically worn near the body's core and are shaped like portals or passageways, making literal the elemental gates kineticists posses within their bodies.

      <line>If you're a kineticist, the attenuator grants you a +1 item bonus to your impulse attack modifier (but not your impulse DC).</line>
      <line>When you invest a <i>gate attenuator</i> (usually as part of your daily preparations), attune it to an element of your choice. Designs on the attenuator's surface transform to match that element, and the attenuator gains the element's trait until it's no longer invested or is attuned to a different element.</line>
