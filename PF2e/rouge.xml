      <trait>Downtime</trait>

      <line>You use one of your skills to make money during downtime. The GM assigns a task level representing the most lucrative job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the GM determining whether you find any. Sometimes you can attempt to find better work than the initial offerings, though this takes time and requires using the Diplomacy skill to Gather Information, doing some research, or socializing.</line>
      <line>When you take on a job, the GM secretly sets the DC of your skill check. After your first day of work, you roll to determine your earnings. You gain an amount of income based on your result, the task's level, and your proficiency rank.</line>
      <line>You can continue working at the task on subsequent days without needing to roll again. For each day you spend after the first, you earn the same amount as the first day, up until the task's completion. The GM determines how long you can work at the task. Most tasks last a week or two, though some can take months or even years.</line>

      <line>You can Steal or Palm an Object that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the -5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a Master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard.

      <line>Palming a small, unattended object without being noticed requires you to roll a single Thievery check against the Perception DCs of all creatures who are currently observing you. You take the object whether or not you successfully conceal that you did so. You can typically only Palm Objects of negligible Bulk, though the GM might determine otherwise depending on the situation.</line>

      <line>Attempt a Thievery check to determine if you successfully Steal the object. The DC to Steal is usually the Perception DC of the creature wearing the object. This assumes the object is worn but not closely guarded (like a loosely carried pouch filled with coins, or an object within such a pouch). If the object is in a pocket or similarly protected, you take a -5 penalty to your Thievery check. The GM might increase the DC of your check if the nature of the object makes it harder to steal (such as a very small item in a large pack, or a sheet of parchment mixed in with other documents).</line>
      <line>You might also need to compare your Thievery check result against the Perception DCs of observers other than the person wearing the object. The GM may decrease the Perception DCs of these observers if they're distracted.</line>

      <prereq>trained in Stealth</prereq>

      <line>You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices that you have Concealed an Object, the GM uses the number rolled or 10 (whichever is higher) as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a Master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're Legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at Concealing the Object.</line>
      <line>This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you're more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.</line>

      <trait>Manipulate</trait> <trait>Secret</trait>

      <line>You hide a small object on your person (such as weapon of light Bulk). When you try to sneak a concealed object past someone who might notice it, the GM rolls your Stealth check and compares it to this passive observer's Perception DC. Once the GM rolls your check for a concealed object, that same result is used no matter how many passive observers you try to sneak it past. If a creature is specifically searching you for an item, it can attempt a Perception check against your Stealth DC instead (finding it on a success).</line>
      <line results="">
         <success>The object remains undetected.</success>
         <fail>The observer finds the object.</fail>
      </line>
      <line>You can also Conceal an Object somewhere other than your person, such as among undergrowth or in a secret compartment within a piece of furniture. In this case, characters Seeking in an area compare their Perception check result to your Stealth DC to determine whether they find the object.</line>

You might even work as a consultant, testing clients' defenses by trying to steal something precious.</line>
      <line>When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.</line>

      <title>Sneak Attack</title>

      <line>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</line>

     <title>Deny Advantage</title>
     <line>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself.

      <trait>Move</trait> <trait>Secret</trait>

      <line>You can attempt to move to another place while becoming or staying undetected. Stride up to half your Speed. (You can use Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type; you must move at half that speed.)</line>
      <line>If you're undetected by a creature and it's impossible for that creature to observe you (for a typical creature, this includes when you're invisible, the observer is blinded, or you're in darkness and the creature can't see in darkness), for any critical failure you roll on a check to Sneak, you get a failure instead. You also continue to be undetected if you lose cover or greater cover against or are no longer concealed from such a creature.</line>
      <line>At the end of your movement, the GM rolls your secret Stealth check and compares the result to the Perception DC of each creature you were hidden from or undetected by at the start of your movement. If you have cover from the creature throughout your Stride, you gain the +2 circumstance bonus from cover (or +4 from greater cover) to your Stealth check. Because you're moving, the bonus increase from Taking Cover doesn't apply. You don't get to roll against a creature if, at the end of your movement, you neather are concealed from it nor have cover or greater cover against it. You automatically become observed by such a creature.</line>

         You become observed as soon as you do anything other than Hide, Sneak, or Step. If you attempt to Strike a creature, the creature remains flat-footed against that attack, and you then become observed. If you do anything else, you become observed just before you actu unless the GM determines otherwise. The GM might allow you to perform a particularly unobtrusive action without being noticed, possibly requiring another Stealth check. If you speak or make a deliberate loud noise, you become hidden instead of undetected.<![CDATA[<br/>]]>
         If a creature uses Seek and you become hidden to it as a result, you must Sneak if you want to become undetected by that creature again.</success>

      <title>Avoid Notice</title>
      <trait>Exploration</trait>

      <line>You attempt a Stealth check to Avoid Notice while traveling at half speed. If you have the Swift Sneak skill feat, you can move at full Speed rather than half, but you still can't use another exploration activity while you do so. If you have the Legendary Sneak skill feat, you can move at full Speed and use a second exploration activity.</line>
      <line>If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you (based on their Perception DCs, as normal for Sneak, regardless of their initiative check results).</line>

      <line>You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.</line>
      <line>You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of Legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.</line>

      <title>Search</title>
      <trait>Concentrate</trait> <trait>Exploration</trait>

      <line>You Seek meticulously for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on. You can usually make an educated guess as to which locations are best to check and move at half speed, but if you want to be thorough and guarantee you checked everything, you need to travel at a Speed of no more than 300 feet per minute, or 150 feet per minute to ensure you check everything before you walk into it. You can always move more slowly while Searching to cover the area more throughly, and the Expeditious Search feat increases these maximum Speeds. If you come across a secret door, item, or hazard while Searching, the GM will attempt a free secret check to Seek to see if you notice the hidden object or hazard. In locations with many objects to search, you have to stop and spend significantly longer to search thoroughly.</line>
