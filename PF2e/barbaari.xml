      <line>With at least 1 minute of conversation, during which you engage in charismatic overtures, flatter, and other acts of goodwill, you seek to make a good impression on someone to make them temporarily agreeable. At the end of the conversation, attempt a Diplomacy check against the Will DC of one target, modified by any circumstance the GM sees fit. Good impressions (or bad impressions, on a critical failure) last for only the current social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise.</line>

However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate — at least in the short term.</critsuccess>
