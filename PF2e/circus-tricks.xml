      <category>All About Tricks</category>
      <line>A trick has three main components: its level, its traits, and the associated skill. It also has a description that ties all these components together narratively, and might have a name.</line>
      <line>The higher a trick's level, the harder it is to successfully perform, but also the more Exctiement and Anticipation it has the potential to generate. A character can not Perform a Trick of a higher level than he or she is.</line>

      <line>The trick's traits and associated skill are somewhat connected; Some traits allow you to use skills that otherwise wouldn't be allowed. Some traits, like <![CDATA[<u>injury</u>]]>, have specific rules attached to them.</line>
      <line>You can choose up to any two basic traits when Performing a Trick if you are trained in Performance or an applicable Lore. If you are an expert, you can choose a specialized trait in place of one basic trait. If you are a master, you can choose up to two specialized traits, and if you are legendary, you can choose up to three basic or specialized traits.</line>
      <line>By default, a trick uses Performance or an applicable Lore as its associated skill. If you have a feat or ability, such as Acrobatic Performer, that allows you to use another skill instead of Performance when you Perform, you can use that skill. Otherwise, you need to use a trait that allows you to change the trait.</line>
      <line name="Special">Feel free to suggest new traits and work with your GM to determine what the effects of that trait should be.</line>
