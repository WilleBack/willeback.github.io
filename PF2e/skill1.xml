This works only once per conversation, and if you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature's attitude to improve. You must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate your status, or ingrate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can't achieve.</line>

      <line>Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions. You can use Occultism instead of Deception to Impersonate a typical worshipper of another faith or to Lie specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are impersonating. You still need to to use Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.</line>

      <prereq>trained in Stealth</prereq>

      <line>You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices that you have Concealed an Object, the GM uses the number rolled or 10 (whichever is higher) as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a Master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're Legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at Concealing the Object.</line>
      <line>This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. Due to your smuggling skill, you're more likely to find more lucrative smuggling jobs when using Underworld Lore to Earn Income.</line>

Since you're using all of the animal, others can't use the caracass's meat for any other purpose, including their own use of All of the Animal.</line>

If you're Legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail</line>

You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.</line>
