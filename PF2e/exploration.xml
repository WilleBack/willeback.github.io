      <trait>Concentrate</trait> <trait>Exploration</trait> <trait>Secret</trait>

      <line>You attempt to decipher complicated writing or literature on an obscure topic. This usually takes 1 minute per page of text, but might take longer (typically an hour per page for decrypting ciphers or the like). The text must be in a language you can read, though the GM might allow you to attempt to decipher text written in an unfamiliar language using Society instead.</line>
      <line>The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or complexity of the document. The GM might have you roll one check for a short text or a check for each section of a larger text.</line>

         <critsuccess>You understand the true meaning of the text.</critsuccess>
         <success>You understand the true meaning of the text. If it was a coded document, you know the general meaning but might not have a word-for-word translation.</success>

      <line>You canvass local markets, taverns, and gathering places in an attempt to lear about a specific individual or topic. The GM determines the DC of the check and the amount of time it takes (typically 2 hours, but sometimes more), along with any benefit you might be able to gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.</line>

      <line>Once you discover that an item, location, or an ongoing effect is magical, you can spend 10 minutes to try identify the particular of its magic. If your attempt is interrupted, you must start over. The GM sets the DC for your check, typically based on the item, location or effect's level. Cursed or esoteric subjects usually have higher DCs or might even be impossible to identify using this activity alone. Heightening a spell doesn't increase the DC to identify it.</line>
      <line results="">
         <critsuccess>You learn all the attributes of the magic, including its name (for an effect), what it does, any means of activating it (for an item or location), and whether it is cursed.</critsuccess>
         <success>For an item or location, you get a sense of what it does and learn any means of activating it. For an ongoing effect (such as a spell with a duration), you learn the effects name and what it does. You can't try again in hopes of getting a critical success.</success>
         <fail>You fail to identify the magic and can't try again for 1 day.</fail>

      <line>You create a disguise to pass yourself off as someone or something you are not. Assembling a convincing disguise takes 10 minutes and requires a disguise kit, but a simpler, quicker disguise might do the job if you're not trying to imitate a specific individual, at the GM's discretion.</line>
      <line>In most cases, creatures have a chance to detect your deception only if they use the Seek action to attempt Perception checks against your Deception DC. If you attempt to directly interact with someone while disguised, the GM rolls a secret Deception check for you against that creature's Perception DC instead. If you're disguised as a specific individual, the GM might give creatures you interact with a circumstance bonus based on how well they know the person you're imitating, or the GM might roll a secret Deception check even if you aren't directly interacting with others.</line>

      <requirement>You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition's spell list.</requirement>

      <line>You can gain access to a new spell of your tradition from someone who knows that spell or from magical writing like a spellbook or scroll. If you can cast spells of multiple traditions, you can Learn a Spell of any of those traditions, but you must use the corresponding skill to do so. For example, if you were a cleric with the bard multiclass archetype, you couldn't use Religion to add an occult spell to your bardic spell repertoire.</line>
      <line>To learn a spell, you must do the following:</line>
      <line list="">
         <entry>Spend 1 hour per level of the spell, during which you must remain in conversation with a person who knows the spell or have the magical writing in your possession.</entry>
         <entry>Have materials with a price depending on the spell's level.</entry>
         <entry>Attempt a skill check for the skill corresponding to your tradition, with uncommon and rare spells generally having higher DCs.</entry>

         <critfail>As failure, plus you expend half the materials.</critfail>
      </line>
      <line>If you have a spellbook, Learning a Spell lets you add the spell to your spellbook; if you prepare spells from a list, it's added to your list; if you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.</line>
