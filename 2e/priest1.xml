            <section>This spell allows a priest to sense how far an individual, creature, object, or area is from a condition of balance -in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed from True Neutral. The spell indicates along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies, but gives no indication of the direction in which the alignement is removed from True Neutral except under certain conditions that follow.</section>
            <section>For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a chaotic neutral creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from the True Neutral by one grade along the law/chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either chaotic neutral or lawful neutral. If the creature was chaotic evil, the spell would indicate that it was removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good.</section>
            <section>The priest also has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the directin of variation along one randomly chosen axis. Thus, a 10th-level priest evaluating the balance of a chaotic neutral creature has a 50% chance to learn that the creature is chaotic (and hence chaotic neutral, since it is only one step away from balance).</section>
            <section>Similar to spells such as <![CDATA[<i>detect evil</i>]]>, this spell won't reveal a hidden trap. If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of Animal or Non-, it always reads True Neutral.</section>
            <section>The material components of this spell are four iron coins, which the priest tosses in his hand while concentrating on the spell (these are not consumed in the casting).</section>

            <section>This spell facilitates the quick analysis of a single opponent by the spellcaster. At 1st level, the priest can divine one salient weakness or strength of a single opponent. At 3rd level and every two levels thereafter up to 9th, the spellcaster can determine an additional strength or weakness. The target of this spell is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving throw is successful, the spell is wasted and nothing is learned.</section>
            <section>For example, if this spell was cast by a 5th-level priest on a troll, he might learn that trolls can regenerate (a strength), that they are particularly susceptible to fire (a weakness), and that this particular troll was partially blind in his left eye. The last nugget of information might translate into a +1 bonus to hit, at the DM's discretion, if the priest attacked so as to exploit the troll's weakness.</section>
            <section>According to legends, a priest used this spell prior to battling a rakshasa. With it, they divined that diabolical race's weakness to <![CDATA[<i>blessed</i>]]> crossbow bolts, a fact that is now known by many adventurers throughout the world.</section>

            <section>This spell enables the caster to determine the fair market value of an object based on the materials used in its construction simply by handling it. The spell does not enable the caster to assess the artistic or cultural value of an object, its magical properties, or even determine if the object is magical.</section>
            <section>The object to be evaluated must be physically smaller in size than the caster. The spell enables the caster to determine the item's value to the nearest gold piece in value to within (plus or minus) 2d10% minus the caster's level. Hence, at 20th level and above, the is no possibility of error.</section>

For example, cats are often associated with agility, foxes with cunning, and so on. The exact characteristic associated with any given species may vary from culture to culture.</section>
            <section>Thus, this spell augments one ability score (the one most closely associated with the animal depicted by 1 point, up to a maximum of 19. Thus, if a bear is associated with strength in the caster's culture, the caster can increase his or her Strength by 1 point (or 10%, for characters with exceptional Strength).</section>
            <section>The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol. The caster must also have an appropriate tattoo.</section>

Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is complated, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering after the cast is completed are not).</section>
            <section>A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt to use against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends.</section>

            <section>The <![CDATA[<i>ceremony</i>]]> spell represents certain functions carried out by religious organizations, and has various applications, depending on the level of the priest. A ceremony does not leave behind an aura of magic (although in some cases an aura of good or evil might be present and thus detectable), and the effects of a ceremony cannot be dispelled. Specific ceremonies vary from religion to religion, but usually encompass these functions:</section>
            <section style="bullet">1st level cleric: coming of age, burial, marriage</section>
            <section style="bullet">3rd level cleric: dedication, investiture, consecrate item</section>

            <section style="bullet">7th level cleric: consecrate ground</section>
            <section style="bullet">9th lecel cleric: anathematize</section>
            <section>Each of these varieties of the <![CDATA[<i>ceremony</i>]]> spell requires a priest of the indicated level or a higher one, with additional restrictions as described below. All <![CDATA[<i>ceremony</i>]]> spells except anathematize have no saving throw, since the recipient is either inanimate or presumed to be willing; these simply fail if performed on someone who is unwilling to recceive the benefit. Briefly, the ceremonies listed do the following things:</section>
            <section><![CDATA[<i>Coming of age</i>]]> is a limited form of <![CDATA[<i>bless</i>]]> that is performed upon a young man (and in some cultures a young woman) at some point relatively early in life, often the age of 12. A young person who undergoes this ceremony receives a +1 bonus to any single saving throw, which can be taken at any time after the coming of age ceremony is completed. In some cultures, the coming of age ceremony has a symbolic significance, such that an adolescent must receive this blessing before he or she can enjoy the rights and privileges of adulthood.</section>

            <section>Using this spell, three to five priests combine their abilities so that one of them casts spells and turns undead at an enhanced level. The highest-level priest (or one of them, if two or more are tied for highest) stands alone, while the others join hands in a surrounding circle. The central priest casts the <![CDATA[<i>combine</i>]]> spell. He temporarily gains one level for each priest in the cricle, up to a maximum gain of four levels. The level increases affects turning undead and spell details that vary with the caster's level. Note that the central priest gains no additional spells and that the group is limited to his currently memorized spells.</section>
            <section>The encircling priests must concentrate on maintaining the combine effect. They lose all Armor Class bonuses for shield and dexterity. If any of them has his concentration broken, the <![CDATA[<i>combine</i>]]> spell ends immediately. If the <![CDATA[<i>combine</i>]]> spell is broken while the central priest is in the act of casting a spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster were disturbed. Spells cast in combination have the full enhanced effect, even if the combine is broken before the duration of the enhanced spell ends. Note that the combination is not broken if only the central caster is disturbed.</section>

The water is clean and drinkable (it is just like rain water). The created water can be dispelled within a round of its creation; otherwise, its magic fades, leaving normal water that can be used, spilled, evaporated, etc. The revers of the spell, <![CDATA[<i>destroy water</i>]]>, obliterates without trace (no vapor, mist, fog, or steam) a like quantity of water. Water can be created or destroyed in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area as large as 27 cubic feet (1 cubic yard).</section>

            <section>This spell discovers emanations of evil, or of good in the case of the reverse spell, from any creature, object, or area. Character alignment, however, is revealed only under unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their faith, and who are at least 9th level might radiate good or evil <![CDATA[<i>if intent upon appropriate actions</i>]]>. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas or ki-rin, send forth emanations of evil or good, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or unintelligent viper does not.</section>
            <section>The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a <![CDATA[<i>detect evil</i>]]> spell is one turn plus five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a path of detection 10 feet wide, in the direction the priest is facing.

            <section>Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar hazards along a path 10 feet wide and 40 feet long. Such hazards include simple pits, deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example, trapdoor spiders, giant sundews, and lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural material (mantraps, missile trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional -the caster must face the desired direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases as the danger approached. The caster leans the general nature of the danger (pit, snare, or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination, however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell detects certain natural hazards -quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe construction, or a naturally poisonous plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect magical traps (save those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell <![CDATA[<i>trip</i>]]> and the 3rd-level spell <![CDATA[<i>snare</i>]]>), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.</section>

During each rond of the spell's duration, the caster can face in only one direction (i.e., only a 20-foot-wide path can be known). The spell lasts one round per level of experience of the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus 20 yards per level of experience.

The character using them must roll normally to hit, although the magic of the stones enables any character to be proficient with them. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature an be struck (those struck only by magic weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone that hits inflicts 1d4 points of damage (2d4 points against undead). The magic in each stone lasts only for half an hour, or until used.</section>
            <section>The material components are the priest's holy symbol and three small pebbles, unworked by tools or magic of any type.</section>
