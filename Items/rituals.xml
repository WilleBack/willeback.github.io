     <line>When you master this ritual, you choose a single type of aberrant creature, such as chaos beast or mind flayer. This choice remains fixed through your adventuring career. If you are able to create ritual scrolls, any scrolls you create also reflect this choice. This ritual can only be mastered once.</line>
     <line>For the ritual's duration, you are able to determine the presence or absence of creatures of the chosen type within 10 miles, but with no specific direction or distance information. If there are any within range, you can connect to the mind of a random creature of that type and try to gain information from it. You must expend a healing surge to make this connection (and to conceal it from the aberrant creature).</line>
     <line>Your Dungeoneering check result determines how many questions you can try to find the answers to. Once you have asked all the questions allowed by the ritual, the ritual ends.</line>
     <line indent="1"><![CDATA[<b>Dungeoneering Check Result</b>]]></line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>9 or lower:</i>]]> One question</line>

     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>30 - 39:</i>]]> Four questions</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>40 or higher:</i>]]> Five questions</line>
     <line>Your questions can be as specific or as general as you wish, but the answers you receive back are cryptic and rarely longer than a phrase, a short sentence, or a single image. In particular, aberrant creatures often have different conceptions of time, so questions regarding future events or plans are more likely to result in answers that are incomprehensible. The answers are also limited to what the individual creature knows, and its information could be incorrect if it has been misled by others.</line>
     <line>If a particual creature does not know the information you seek, you can try to find another individual who does know it. If there is another creature of the chosen type, you can expend a healing surge to connect (and conceal) to that creature, and re-ask any questions for which you received no answer.</line>
     <line><![CDATA[<b>Special:</b>]]> Members of the Morphic Web can master and perform this ritual even if they cannot normally master rituals. They also do not expend a healing surge to make the first connection.</line>

     <line>You command an immortal creature whose level does not exceed yours. The subject of this ritual must be able to see and hear you and must remain within 5 squares of you for the entire time necessary to perform the ritual. Because most creatures do not willingly submit to this ritual, you must usually make the creature helpless or restrain the creature by means of a <![CDATA[<i>magic circle</i>]]> ritual. Unless it is prevented from doing so, the creature can leave at any time. Finally, you must be able to communicate with the creature, or the ritual automatically fails.</line>
     <line>To determine the extent of your authority over the subject, you engage in a special skill challenge during the time it takes to perform the ritual. The DC for all checks is a Moderate DC of the subject's level, and the primary skill is Religion; each time you or an ally succeeds on a Religion check in the challenge, you or an ally can use Diplomacy, History, Arcana, or Intimidate for the next attempted check. Attempting an Intimidate check increases the DC of Diplomacy checks by +5 for the rest of the skill challenge.</line>
     <line>Once you have amassed 3 failures or achieved 10 successes, the skill challenge ends. Consult the following values and apply the effect for the number of successes you achieved:</line>
     <line indent="1"><![CDATA[<b>Number of Successes</b>]]></line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>0 or 1:</i>]]> The creature has authority over you and can issue one command that you must obey, a task that requires up to a day of effort.</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>2 or 3:</i>]]> You have immediate authority over the creature and can command it to perform one task that takes no more than 5 minutes.</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>4 or 5:</i>]]> You have moderate authority over the creature and can command it to perform a task that requires up to a day of effort.</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>6 or 7:</i>]]> You have significant authority over the creature and can command it to perform a task that requires up to a week of effort.</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>8 or 9:</i>]]> You have great authority over the creature and can command it to perform a task that requires up to a month of effort.</line>
     <line indent="2"><![CDATA[<i>10:</i>]]> You have ultimate authority over the creature and can command it to perform a task that requires up to a year an a day of effort.</line>
     <line>When the specified task is completed, the ritual is discharged, and the creature (or you) is released from service.</line>
     <line>The requested task can be any kind that does not compel the subject to obey multiple commands, force the subject to engage in combat, or ensure the subject's death (the subject can engage in combat to achieve a task if it wishes, but combat cannot be required). If the task is impossible, such as commanding a creature that cannot fly to soar into the sky, the creature can ignore the command.</line>

     <line>You gain mastery over nonmagical fire. For the duration of the ritual, or until you take an extended rest, you can manipulate nonmagical flames within 10 squares of you as a minor action.</line>
     <line>You can make a fire that normally proves only dim light produce an equal amount of bright light and dim light up to twice the distance, or you can double the radius of light produced by a fire that produces both bright and dim light.</line>
     <line>Alternatively, you can diminish a fire's light, reducing its bright light to dim light and dim light to darkness. Reducing a fire's light does not extinguish the flame.</line>
     <line>You can also extinguish 1 square of nonmagical fire as a minor action, or expand nonmagical fire into 1 adjacent square that has sufficient fuel for the fire.</line>

      <time>10 minutes</time>
      <duration>8 hours or until discharged</duration>

      <line>You ward an area up to 10 squares by 10 squares, and designate a spoken password that allows a creature to enter the warded area without triggering an alarm. This alarm can send a mental signal to you or make an audible ringing sound.</line>
      <line>If a Tiny or larger creature enters the warded area without speaking the password, the alarm you set triggers, and the ritual is discharged. However, an insubstantial creature or any creature that succeeds on a Stealth check against your passive Arcana does not trigger the alarm.</line>
      <line>The result of triggering the alarm depends on the type of alarm:</line>
      <line indent="1">When an audible alarm triggers, all creatures in the warded area that are capable of hearing can hear the ringing. If they are sleeping, the noise awakens them.</line>
      <line indent="1">When a mental alarm triggers, a mental ping alerts you to the intrusion and awakens you from sleep.</line>
      <line>In either case, the alarm informs you where the warded area was breached.</line>
      <line><![CDATA[<b>Focus:</b>]]> A tiny bell (5 gp), and a fine silver wire (5 gp); you hold the bell and use the wire to scribe runes on the warded area's perimeter.</line>

      <duration>Permanent</duration>

      <line>You capture the writing from one source (such as a book, scroll, or tablet) and cause it to appear onto a specially prepared paper, parchment, book, or some other similar item. This ritual copies up to 250 words of text, enough to fill one page with text. A copied illustration counts as a number of words proportional to the amount of the page the illustration requires.</line>
      <line>This ritual can be used to copy a ritual scroll, even if you have not mastered the ritual on the original scroll. Creating a ritual scroll in this way costs the normal amount for creating a ritual scroll, in addition to the component cost for this ritual, and takes a quarter of the time in addition to the time spent to perform this ritual.</line>

      <line>You target a nonhostile Tiny animal, such as a sparrow, a raven, a fox, or a carp. The animal must remain within 5 squares of you for the time necessary to perform the ritual.</line>
      <line>Once the ritual is complete, you whisper a message of up to 25 words to the animal and name a recipient and a location. The animal bounds off towards the location, in search of the recipient. The animal avoids danger along its path. Upon finding the recipient, the animal approaches until it is adjacent to the recipient, and your whisper issues from the animal's mouth, conveying the message.</line>
      <line>When the animal delivers its message or the ritual's duration ends, your influence ends and the animal reverts to its natural behavior. Your Nature check determines how long the animal is affected by the ritual:</line>
