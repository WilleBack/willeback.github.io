		<name>Physical Qualities</name>
		<benefit>Dwarves average about 4Â½ feet in height and are very broad, weighing as much as an adult human. Dwarves have the same variety of skin, eye, and hair colors as humans, although dwarf skin is sometimes gray or sandstone red and red hair is more common among them. Male dwarves are often bald and braid their beards into elaborate patterns. Female dwarves braid their hair to show clan and ancestry. Dwarven attire and equipment, including weapons and shields, are decorated with bold geometric shapes, natural gems, and ancestral faces.</benefit>
		<benefit>Although they reach physical maturity at roughly the same age as humans, dwarves age more slowly and remain vigorous well past 150 years of age, often living to see 200.</benefit>
	</feature>
	
	<feature>
		<name>Playing a Dwarf</name>
		<benefit>Proudly proclaiming they were made from the earth itself, dwarves share many qualities with the rock they love. They are strong, hardy, and dependable. They value their ancestral traditions, which they preserve through the ages as fiercely as they defend the carved structures of their mountain homes.</benefit>
		<benefit>Dwarves believe in the importance of clan ties and ancestry. They deeply respect their elders, and they honor long-dead clan founders and ancestral heroes. They place great value on wisdom and the experience of years, and most are polite to elders of any race.</benefit>
		<benefit>More so than most other races, dwarves seek guidance and protection from the gods. They look to the divine for strength, hope, and inspiration, or they seek to propitiate cruel or destructive gods. Individual dwarves might be impious or openly heretical, but temples and shrines of some sort are found in almost every dwarven community. Dwarves revere Moradin as their creator, but individual dwarves honor those deities who hold sway over their vocations; warriors pray to Bahamut or Kord, architects to Erathis, and merchants to Avandra -or even Tiamat, if a dwarf is consumed by the dwarven taste for wealth.</benefit>
		<benefit>Dwarves never forget their enemies, either individuals who have wronged them or entire races of monsters who have done ill to their kind. Dwarves harbor a fierce hatred for orcs, which often inhabit the same mountainous areas that dwarves favor and which wreak periodic devastation on dwarf communities. Dwarves also despise giants and titans, because the dwarf race once labored as the giants' slaves. They feel a mixture of pity and disgust towards those corrupted dwarfkin who still have not freed themselves from the giants' yoke -azers and galeb duhrs among them.</benefit>
		<benefit>To a dwarf, it is a gift and a mark of deep respect to stand beside an ally in battle, and a sign of deepest loyalty to shield an ally from enemy attack. Dwarven legends honor many heroes who gave their lives to save their clans of their friends.</benefit>

		<name>Sample Dwarf Adventurers</name>
		<benefit>Three sample adventurers are described below. You can use these as inspiration for your own character.</benefit>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Lidda, Halfling Rogue</name>
			<benefit>Lidda possesses a quick wit and an acid tongue. At a young age, she left her family out of a desire to see more of the world and experience first-hand the wonders described in the stories she grew up hearing.</benefit>
			<benefit>She has joined several different adventuring groups during her career, and even though her displays of sarcasm and wry humor at her companions' expense would suggest otherwise, she counts each of them as a close friend.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Garret, Halfling Ranger</name>
			<benefit>Several years ago, Garret's grandfather sent him to look for a distant branch of his family that had stopped responding to messages. He found the whole clan had been killed, and he returned to bring the sad news to his family. From that time, he has been unable to stay in one place for long.</benefit>
			<benefit>He doesn't know who or what killed his relatives and doesn't dream of vengeance, but he hopes to do some good in the world that might somehow balance out the atrocity of their murders.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Verna, Halfling Warlock</name>
			<benefit>Verna is a Warlock -and among the most cheerful and gregarious of halflings. The otherworldly powers she channels seem to leave no mark on her spirit or mind. She takes no delight in killing, but uses lethal powers as a practical matter, to protect herself and her allies.</benefit>
			<benefit>She doesn't often talk of the event that propelled her into a life of adventuring and a pact with an otherworldly powers: A creature appeared in a a vision and offered her power, in exchange for a favor to be named later. In what she still regards as a moment of folly, she accepted. Nightmares of her unknown future haunt her sleep, but she never speaks of them.</benefit>
