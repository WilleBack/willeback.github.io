	<feature>
		<name>Physical Qualities</name>
		<benefit>Dragonborn resemble humanoid dragons. They're covered in scaly hide, but they don't have tails. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6Â½ feet in height and weighing up to 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. A dragonborn's head features a blunt snout, a strong brow, and distinctive frills at the cheek and ear. Behind the brow, a crest of hornlike scales of various lengths resembles thick, ropy hair. Their eyes are shades of red or gold.</benefit>
		<benefit>A typical dragonborn's scales can be scarlet, gold, rust, ocher, bronze, or brown. Rarely do an individual's scales match the hue or metallic dragon, and scale color gives no indication of the type of breath weapon a dragonborn might have. Most dragonborn have very fine scales over most of their body, giving their skin a leathery texture, with regions of larger scales on the forearms, lower legs and feet, shoulders, and thighs.</benefit>
		<benefit>Young dragonborn grow faster than human children do. They walk hours after hatching, reach the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live about as long as humans do.</benefit>
	</feature>
	
	<feature>
		<name>Playing a Dragonborn</name>
		<benefit>To a dragonborn, honor is more important than life itself. First and foremost, honor is tied to a battlefield conduct. Adversaries should be treated with courtesy and respect, even if they are bitter enemies. Caution and discretion are key to a warrior's survival, but fear is a disease and cowardice is a moral failing.</benefit>
		<benefit>The drive to behave honorably extends into the rest of a dragonborn's life: Breaking an oath is the height of dishonor, and attention to honesty extends to every world. A commitment made must be carried out. Ultimatey, a dragonborn takes responsibility for his or her actions and their consequences.</benefit>

		<name>Sample Halfling Adventurers</name>
		<benefit>Three sample adventurers are described below. You can use these as inspiration for your own character.</benefit>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Lidda, Halfling Rogue</name>
			<benefit>Lidda possesses a quick wit and an acid tongue. At a young age, she left her family out of a desire to see more of the world and experience first-hand the wonders described in the stories she grew up hearing.</benefit>
			<benefit>She has joined several different adventuring groups during her career, and even though her displays of sarcasm and wry humor at her companions' expense would suggest otherwise, she counts each of them as a close friend.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Garret, Halfling Ranger</name>
			<benefit>Several years ago, Garret's grandfather sent him to look for a distant branch of his family that had stopped responding to messages. He found the whole clan had been killed, and he returned to bring the sad news to his family. From that time, he has been unable to stay in one place for long.</benefit>
			<benefit>He doesn't know who or what killed his relatives and doesn't dream of vengeance, but he hopes to do some good in the world that might somehow balance out the atrocity of their murders.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Verna</name>
			<benefit>Verna is a Warlock -and among the most cheerful and gregarious of halflings. The otherworldly powers she channels seem to leave no mark on her spirit or mind. She takes no delight in killing, but uses lethal powers as a practical matter, to protect herself and her allies.</benefit>
			<benefit>She doesn't often talk of the event that propelled her into a life of adventuring and a pact with an otherworldly powers: A creature appeared in a a vision and offered her power, in exchange for a favor to be named later. In what she still regards as a moment of folly, she accepted. Nightmares of her unknown future haunt her sleep, but she never speaks of them.</benefit>
