	<feature>
		<name>Physical Qualities</name>
		<benefit>Eladrin are of human height. They are slim, and even the strongest simply look athletic rather than muscle-bound. They have the same range of complexions as humans, though they are more often fair than dark. Their straight, fine hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their ears are long and pointed, and their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils. Eladrin can't grow facial hair and have little body hair.</benefit>
		<benefit>Eladrin children grow much as homan children do, but their aging process slows to a crawl when they reach maturity. They enjoy youth and health for most of their lives and don't begin to feel the effects of age until the middle of their third century. Most live for over 300 years, and even at the end they suffer few of the infirmities of old age.</benefit>
	</feature>
	
	<feature>
		<name>Playing an Eladrin</name>
		<benefit>Eladrin society straddles the boundary between the Feywild and and the natural world. Eladrin build their elegant cities and towers in places of striking natural splendor, especially where the vail between the worlds is thin: isolated mountain vales, green islands along wild and storm-wracked coasts, and the deepest recesses of ancient forests. Some eladrin realms exist mostly in the Feywild, only rarely touching the world, while others appear in the world at sunset each day, only to fade back into the Feywild at dawn.</benefit>
		<benefit>Long-lived and strongly tied to the Feywild, eladrin have a detached view of the world. Eladrin often have difficulty believing that events in the world have much importance to them, and they consider courses of action that can last for centuries.</benefit>
		<benefit>Their general detachment from the world can make eladrin seem distant and intimidating to other races. Their fey nature also makes them simultaneously alluring and a little frightening. However, eladrin take friendships and alliances to heart and can react with swift fury when their friends are endangered. Combined with their intellect, bravery, and magical power, this loyalty makes them powerful and respected allies.</benefit>
		<benefit>Eladrin live by an aesthetic philosophy common to the Feywild and personified by Corellon, the god of beauty and patron of the fey. Eladrin seek to exemplify grace, skill, and learning in every part of life, from dance and song to swordplay and magic. Their cities are places of stunning beauty that shape and guide their natural surroundings into elegant forms.</benefit>
		<benefit>Eladrin are close cousins to the elves and are occasionally called high elves or gray elves. Eladrin favor the Feywild and arcane magic more than elves do, but the two races hold each other in high regard. They share a burning hatred for the third branch of their race -the drow.</benefit>
		<benefit>The Feywild's most powerful eladrin, called noble eladrin, become so infused with their realm's inherent magic that they transform into entirely new creatures. These noble eladrin take on characteristics of the seasons and other natural phenomena.</benefit>

		<name>Sample Eladrin Adventurers</name>
		<benefit>Three sample adventurers are described below. You can use these as inspiration for your own character.</benefit>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Meriele, Eladrin Wizard</name>
			<benefit>Although Meriele's magic favors powers of thunder and lightning, she stands as a point of tranquility in the storm. To her friends, she seems above the world's tumult, present in their midst but clearly apart by her nature.</benefit>
			<benefit>In the evenings, while her companions set up camp and settle in to rest, she slips into a trance and, in her mind, walks among the ageless trees of the Feywild. She smiles at the impatience and impulsiveness of her allies, but they are almost as dear to her as her spellbook.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Quarion, Eladrin Rogue</name>
			<benefit>Quarion is as comfortable in the shadows of the world as in the twilight of the Feywild. He moves with the grace of a panther and can be uncannily silent when he chooses.</benefit>
			<benefit>In combat, he finds his mind slipping out of time, as though he were watching himself and his foes moving at a snail's pace. His enemies' attacks are easy to calculate, their defenses easy to anticipate and circumvent. Combat is a carefully choreographed dance in his mind, and he savors its elegance.</benefit>
		</subfeature>
		
		<subfeature>
			<name>Anastrianna, Eladrin Warlord</name>
			<benefit>Anastrianna once served as a guard in the castle of a noble eladrin, a ghaele of winter. Banished at the ghaele's angry whim, Anastrianna has turned her back on the Feywild entirely.</benefit>
			<benefit>She is haunted by beautiful visions of herself at the head of a fey army, banners fluttering against a sapphire sky and blood staining the perfect snow, and she imagines that her destiny will lead her against her former lady someday.</benefit>
