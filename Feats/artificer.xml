      <benefit>When you hit an enemy with an arcane at-will attack power, it is subject to your riposte until the start of your next turn.</benefit>
      <benefit>If the enemy makes an attack against you while subject to your riposte, it takes damage after its attack has been resolved. The damage is of the same type as was dealt by your arcane at-will attack, and the damage equals the ability modifier you used for the damage + the enhancement bonus of the weapon or implement you used. If the enemy is marked by you, halve this damage.</benefit>
