   <text>Torog is the evil god of the Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King that Crawls burrows up from below and drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. Jailers and torturers pray to him in deep caves and cellars, and creatures of the Underdark revere him as well. He teaches his worshipers to:</text>
   <text>&#9658; Seek out and revere the deep places beneath the earth.</text>
   <text>&#9658; Delight in the giving of pain, and consider pain you receive as homage to Torog.</text>
   <text>&#9658; Bind tightly what is in your charge, and restrain those who wander free.</text>
