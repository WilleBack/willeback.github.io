	<fluff>Savage barbarians charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For their foes, the moments of greatest terror come when savages call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. </fluff>
	<fluff>Their rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals. As the barbarian becomes more experienced, the rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power of gifting supernatural recuperative powers. </fluff>
