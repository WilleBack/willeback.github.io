	<fluff>Savage barbarians charge from foe to foe and seldom feel the pain of an enemy's strike. For their foes, the moments of greatest terror come when savages call upon primal forces to lend power to their raging spirits. </fluff>
	<fluff>Their rages, although temporary, give a barbarian incredible powers, a combination of skill, willpower, and a legacy of ancient tribal rituals. As the barbarian becomes more experienced, the rages transcend mortal limitations, manifesting directly as waves of elemental power of gifting supernatural recuperative powers. </fluff>

			<name>Thunderborn Wrath</name>
			<benefit>While some barbarians can be mistaken for mere warriors bereft of primal power when they are not raging, that is not the case with Thunderborn barbarians. They have endeared primal spirits of thunder that circle around them with the low rumble of thunder that explodes into booming roars over their enemies.</benefit>

			<benefit>Once per round, when your attack bloodies an enemy, each enemy adjacent to you takes thunder damage equal to your Constitution modifier. This increases to 3 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and to 6 + your Constitution at 21st level. The damage increases by +5 if you are raging.</benefit>

	<feature>
		<name>Savage Rage</name>
		<benefit>When the savages' unbridled rage overtakes them, they become beacons of the spirit world, and their rage sounds like a gong calling to the primal spirits that a drawn to strong emotion. The spirits are able to inhabit the savage during his or her rage, lending energy and enabling incredible, even supernatural, feats.</benefit>
		<benefit>When you use a Barbarian power with the Rage keyword, you enter a Rage and gain the benefits listed below before resolving the power.

		<benefit>&#9658; You take a -2 penalty to all defenses.</benefit>
		<benefit>&#9658; When you make an attack that uses Strength for the attack roll and has the Weapon keyword, you deal +1[W] damage. This bonus increases to +2[W] at 21st level.</benefit>
		<benefit>&#9658; Your Barbarian at-will attacks and some of your other powers have additional or increased effects while you are raging.</benefit>
		<benefit>&#9658; You gain the benefits of the Rage power you used to enter the Rage, if any.</benefit>
		<benefit>&#9658; If you are already raging and use a Rage power, you either change your Rage before resolving the power or gain a different benefit, as defined in the power.</benefit>
