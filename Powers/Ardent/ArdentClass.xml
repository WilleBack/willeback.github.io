	<fluff>Those who let their base emotions rule them invite madness and destruction. Prolonged feelings of fear, greed, lust, or hatred can weaken the mind's defenses against manipulation. Wielding psionic power, an Ardent excites such emotions in his or her enemies, creating gaps in their defenses and frustrating their attacks, all while filling his or her allies with encouraging thoughts and guarding them against despair and other negative emotions.</fluff>
   <fluff>Ardents rarely learn their art through formal training. In many ways, they are incidental leaders, having stumbled onto psionic power at some point earlier in their lives. How an Excitant discovered his or her psionic talent can shape how one wields this power now. He or she might have awakened to the talent in the heat of battle, experiencing a mental breakthrough that allowed him or her to augment attacks by rending the enemies' minds. Or an Excitant's friends might reflect his or her power when the Excitant's mood bleeds into theirs, altering their emotional states to match his or her own. Regardless of the revelation, an Ardent learned to harness this power to support his or her fighting prowess and to guide allies to victory.</fluff>

		<name>Ardent Mantle</name>

   <feature>
      <name>Mind is Willing</name>
      <benefit>An Excitant's influence is such that when his or her allies' bodies grow weak, their minds are strong enough to push them on.</benefit>
      <benefit>During a short rest, your allies regain additional hit points. For the first healing surge each ally spends during the short rest, he or she regains additional hit points equal to one-half his or her healing surge value.</benefit>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Psionic Augmentation</name>
      <benefit>Through discipline and careful study, an Ardent masters a form of psionic magic that offers greater versatility than other characters command. He or she knows a broad array of at-will powers, each of which is a conduit through which he or she pours as much or as little psionic energy as desired.</benefit>
      <benefit>You channel psionic energy from a reservoir of personal power -represented in the game as power points- that you can use to augment your at-will attack powers, replacing the encounter attack powers that other characters use. Because of this, you acquire and use powers in a slightly different manner from how most other classes do.</benefit>
      <benefit><![CDATA[<b>At-Will Attack Powers:</b>]]> At 1st level, you choose two at-will attack powers and one daily attack power from your class, but you don't start with any encounter attack powers from your class. You can instead augment your class at-will attack powers using power points. These powers have the Augmentable keyword.</benefit>
      <benefit>You gain new at-will attack powers from this class, instead of new encounter attack powers, as you increase in level. At 3rd level and 7th level, you choose a new at-will attack power of that level or lower from this class. At 13th, 17th, 23rd, and 27th level, you can replace one of your at-will attack powers with another one of your level or lower. Both the replaced power and the new power must be Augmentable and from this class.</benefit>
      <benefit><![CDATA[<b>Power Points:</b>]]> You start with 2 power points. You gain 2 additional power points at 3rd, 7th, and 13th level, and 3 additional power points at 17th, 23rd, and 27th level. If you gain power points from another source (such as your paragon path), add them to your power point total. You can use your power points to augment any Augmentable power you have, regardless of how you gained the power.</benefit>
      <benefit>You regain all your power points when you take a short or an extended rest, or when an effect allows you to regain all your expended encounter attack powers.</benefit>
      <benefit>If an effect allows you to regain a single expended encounter attack power of a given level, you instead regain a number of power points equal to the highest augment option you have of that level or lower.</benefit>
   </feature>
