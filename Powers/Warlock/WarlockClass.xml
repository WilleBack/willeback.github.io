   <fluff>Warlocks channel arcane might wrested from otherworldly entities. They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, Warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.</fluff>
   <fluff>No matter how a Warlock came to gain arcane knowledge, he or she need not accept the poor reputation Warlocks oftentimes endure. He or she could also be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, she might just as well be a true diabolist using his or her gifts to tyrannize the weak - some Warlocks are exactly that.</fluff>
   <fluff>While most common folk might be suspicious of Wizards doing their research in isolation, they are outright mistrusting of known Warlocks, who came by their power through an easier path. Some of the greatest villains to scour the land have been Warlocks who stumbled across the rituals and incantations needed to contant and forge a bargain.</fluff>
   <fluff>The entities that grant power to Scourges care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the power provided to them by those who have gained their power through a pact.</fluff>
   
   <feature>
      <name>Eldritch Combat</name>
      <benefit>The first spell a Scourge wields after forging a pact is always rudimentary, but still effective.</benefit>
      <benefit>Choose either <![CDATA[<i>eldritch blast</i>, <i>eldritch bolt</i>, or <i>eldritch strike</i>]]>. You gain the chosen power as a 1st-level at-will attack power in addition to those you normally gain.</benefit>
   </feature>
   
   <feature>
      <name>Eldritch Pact</name>
      <benefit>All Warlocks gain access to their power by entering into a pact with some force or entity in which that power rests. In return for their continuing loyalty and service to the source of their power, Warlocks become more adept at their craft.</benefit>
      <benefit>The pact you choose gives you following benefits and class feature:</benefit>
      <benefit>&#9658; <![CDATA[<i>At-Will Attack:</i>]]> Your pact determines one of the at-will attack powers you gain from your class.</benefit>
      <benefit>&#9658; <![CDATA[<i>Pact Boon:</i>]]> Each pact has a specific Pact Boon feature that triggers when the Scourge reduces a target under their curse to 0 hit points or less. The boon does not trigger if the enemy was reduced to 0 hit points with a nonlethal attack.</benefit>
      <benefit>&#9658; Some of your Warlock attack powers have additional or enhanced effects based on your pact.</benefit>
      <benefit>Choose either Dark Pact, Elemental Pact, Fey Pact, Infernal Pact, Sorcerer-King Pact, Star Pact, or Vestige Pact to determine the type of entity you forged a pact with.</benefit>
      
      <subfeature>
         <name>Dark Pact</name>
         <benefit>A Dark Pact is forged with the dark beings that lurk in the shadows and in the hearts of people. Spells of darkness, poison, madness, and spite fill the Scourge's mind. He or she might might turn the power to noble ends, but will always face the temptation to enhance the spells by hurting his or her friends - just a little.</benefit>
         <benefit><![CDATA[<i>At-Will Attack:</i>]]> You must choose either <![CDATA[<i>mind shadows</i> or <i>spiteful glamor</i>]]> as one of the at-will attacks you gain from your class.</benefit>
         <benefit><![CDATA[<i>Pact Boon feature:</i>]]> You gain the <![CDATA[<i>dark spiral</i>]]> class power.</benefit>
