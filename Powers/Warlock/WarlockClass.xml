   <fluff>Warlocks channel arcane might wrested from otherworldly entities. They commune with infernal intelligences and fey spirits, scour enemies with potent blasts of eldritch power, and bedevil foes with hexing curses. Armed with esoteric secrets and dangerous lore, Warlocks are clever and resourceful foes.</fluff>
   <fluff>No matter how a Warlock came to gain arcane knowledge, he or she need not accept the poor reputation Warlocks oftentimes endure. He or she could also be a libram-toting scholar captivated by ominous lore, a foot-loose wanderer searching for elusive ultimate truths, a devil-touched hunter using infernal spells to eliminate evil, or even a black-clad mercenary who uses sinister trappings to discourage prying strangers and unwanted attention. On the other hand, she might just as well be a true diabolist using his or her gifts to tyrannize the weak - some Warlocks are exactly that.</fluff>
   <fluff>While most common folk might be suspicious of Wizards doing their research in isolation, they are outright mistrusting of known Warlocks, who came by their power through an easier path. Some of the greatest villains to scour the land have been Warlocks who stumbled across the rituals and incantations needed to contant and forge a bargain.</fluff>
   <fluff>The entities that grant power to Scourges care little for how such a gift is used. Their interest is focused on the souls and the power provided to them by those who have gained their power through a pact.</fluff>
