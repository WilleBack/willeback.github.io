   <fluff>Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation.</fluff>
   <fluff>A Tinkerer, might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items or, alternatively, someone who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps an explorer who found arcane knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of his or her talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives a Tinkerer to perfect his or her art.</fluff>
   <fluff>With a bandolier slung across his or her chest, an Artificer carries an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. His or her weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. A Tinkerer mixes reagents, drinks potions, and crafts items. Through the use of knowledge, an Artificer infuses himself or herself and his or her allies with arcane power. And one day, his or her magical skills will carry a Tinkerer into legend.</fluff>
   
   <feature>
      <name>Arcane Empowerment</name>
      <benefit>The study of magic has given Tinkerers the ability to manipulate the arcane energies contained within magical items. He or she can either make them strike true or to recharge their expended energy.</benefit>

      <benefit><![CDATA[<b><i>Augment Energy</i></b>]]></benefit>
      <benefit>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended.</benefit>
      <benefit>The wielder of the weapon or implement can use a free interrupt after making an attack roll to expend the energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. A given implement or weapon can be augmented only once per day.</benefit>
      <benefit><![CDATA[<b><i>Impart Energy</i></b>]]></benefit>
      <benefit>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. You can impart energy on a given item only once per day.</benefit>
   </feature>
   
   <feature>
      <name>Arcane Rejuvenation</name>
      <benefi>Before combat, a Tinkerer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with reinforcing energies that are triggered when the item is used.</benefit>
      <benefit>Whenever one of your allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier, or one-half of this amount when using a magic item's encounter power.</benefit>
