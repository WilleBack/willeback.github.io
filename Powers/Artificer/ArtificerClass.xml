   <fluff>Artificers treat mastery of magic like a technical skill. They see patterns in energy and matter, and they understand how to manipulate the flow of magic in and around objects and creatures. Artificers channel energy into items using magical components, diagrams, and complex chains of sigils. Their skills let them assemble a magic device for any situation.</fluff>
   <fluff>A Tinkerer, might be a formal student of magic who became interested in artifacts and arcane items or, alternatively, someone who devised magic tools in a musty basement. Or perhaps an explorer who found arcane knowledge in the forgotten places of the world. Whatever the source of his or her talents, a passion for the technical components of magic drives a Tinkerer to perfect his or her art.</fluff>
   <fluff>With a bandolier slung across his or her chest, an Artificer carries an arsenal of alchemical compounds, magic implements, mundane materials, and tools. His or her weapons, implements, and other gear are inscribed with runes and mystic patterns. A Tinkerer mixes reagents, drinks potions, and crafts items. Through the use of knowledge, an Artificer infuses himself or herself and his or her allies with arcane power. And one day, his or her magical skills will carry a Tinkerer into legend.</fluff>

   <feature>
      <name>Arcane Empowerment</name>
      <benefit>The study of magic has given Tinkerers the ability to manipulate the arcane energies contained within magical items. He or she can either make them strike true or to recharge their expended energy.</benefit>
      <benefit>When you finish an extended rest, you gain the ability to empower one item, and you gain an additional use of this ability each time you finish an encounter.</benefit>
      <benefit>When you empower an item, you can choose to either Augment Energy, or to Impart Energy.</benefit>
      <benefit><![CDATA[<b><i>Augment Energy</i></b>]]></benefit>
      <benefit>You infuse a weapon or an implement with a reservoir of energy that lasts until the end of your next extended rest or until it is expended.</benefit>
      <benefit>The wielder of the weapon or implement can use a free interrupt after making an attack roll to expend the energy to gain a +2 bonus to that attack roll. A given implement or weapon can be augmented only once per day.</benefit>
      <benefit><![CDATA[<b><i>Impart Energy</i></b>]]></benefit>
      <benefit>You recharge the daily power of a magic item. You can impart energy on a given item only once per day.</benefit>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Arcane Rejuvenation</name>
      <benefit>Before combat, a Tinkerer spends time infusing his or her allies' magic items with reinforcing energies that are triggered when the item is used.</benefit>
      <benefit>Whenever one of your allies uses a magic item's daily power, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to one-half your level + your Intelligence modifier, or one-half of this amount when using a magic item's encounter power.</benefit>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Esoteric Lore</name>
      <benefit>An Artificer will always carry a tome where he or she has noted down all his or her accumulated lore, down to the finest detail.</benefit>
      <benefit>Choose either Alchemical Crafting or Ritual Casting as the type of lore your Tinkerer collects.</benefit>

      <subfeature>
         <name>Alchemical Crafting</name>
         <benefit>Some Artificers' tome of lore is filled with formulae and recipes used to concoct alchemical creations.</benefit>
         <benefit>You gain the Alchemist feat.</benefit>
         <benefit>You gain a formula book containing the formulas for any four alchemical items of your choice. The formulas can be of any level, though you can still only craft alchemical items of your level or lower.</benefit>
         <benefit>Also, whenever you finish a rest, you can create one alchemical item of a lower level than you are without paying the component cost. You must have mastered the formula for the item, and can have only one such item in existence at one time.</benefit>
      </subfeature>

      <subfeature>
         <name>Ritual Casting</name>
         <benefit>Many Artificers collect rituals in their tome, specifically those used in the creation of magical items.</benefit>
         <benefit>You gain the Ritual Caster feat.</benefit>
         <benefit>You gain a ritual book that contains the following rituals: Brew Potion, Disenchant Magic Item, Enchant Magic Item, and Make Whole.</benefit>
         <benefit>In addition, you can use the Disenchant Magic Item ritual without expending any components.</benefit>
      </subfeature>
   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Magical Infusion</name>
      <benefit>Using his or her basic artifice skills, each day a Tinkerer prepares vials infused with magical energies. These vials can be then used during the day to heal or protect.</benefit>
      <benefit>When you finish an extended rest, you prepare two infusions that last until the end of your next extended rest. Starting at 16th level, you instead prepare three infusions.</benefit>
      <benefit>During a short rest, you or an ally can spend a healing surge to replenish an expended infusion.</benefit>
      <benefit>You gain the <![CDATA[<i>curative admixture</i>, <i>resistive formula</i> and <i>shielding elixir</i>]]> class powers. You expend your infusions to use these powers.</benefit>
