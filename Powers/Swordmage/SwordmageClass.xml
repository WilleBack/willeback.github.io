	<fluff>A Swordmage studies and practices for years to master his or her skills, mastering the fundamentals of arcane magic and combining the academic study with endless hours of physical training.</fluff>

The weapon pulses with eldritch energy as a Spellblade prepares to both defend allies and to unleash magical fury against foes.</fluff>

	<feature>
		<name>Swordbond</name>
		<benefit>Though they are masters of many weapons, for a given Swordmage there is always one weapon that he or she considers special. Through an arcane rite, the weapon becomes bound to the Swordmage and grants him or her additional capabilities.</benefit>
		<benefit>You can spend 1 hour of meditation to bond with one melee weapon that you can use as an implement (normally, a light blade or a heavy blade). You can have only one bonded weapon; performing the meditation with a different weapon causes the previous bond to dissipate.</benefit>
		<benefit>You can call your bonded weapon to your hand from up to 10 squares away as a standard action. If you can see the weapon, you can choose for it to fly through the air to your hand, otherwise it teleports to your hand. You can only call your weapon once per turn.</benefit>
		<benefit>Starting at 11th level, you can call the weapon from up to 20 squares away as a standard action, or up to 10 squares away as a minor action. Starting at 21st level, you can call it from up to 1 mile away as a standard action, up to 20 squares away as a minor action, or up to 10 squares away as part of the same action to use it.</benefit>
		<benefit>Also, when you make a <![CDATA[<i>melee basic attack</i>]]> with your bonded weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack roll and damage roll. If your bonded weapon can be thrown, you can also use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier or Strength modifier when making a <![CDATA[<i>ranged basic attack</i>]]>.</benefit>
	</feature>

	<feature>
		<name>Swordmage Warding</name>
		<benefit>When a Swordmage is able to focus their arcane power, he or she can maintain a field of magical force as protection.</benefit>
		<benefit>While you are conscious, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +3 if you are wielding a weapon you can use as an implement in one hand, and have your other hand free (not carrying a shield, an off-hand weapon, wielding a two-handed weapon, or anything else).</benefit>
