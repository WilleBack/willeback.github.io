	<fluff>An Arcanist is spellcaster who focuses on the tenets of a particular school of magic. This specialization makes each Arcanist distinctive. After all, a wizard who casts evocation presents a very different picture to the world from one who has mastered the art of illusion or enchantment.</fluff>
	<fluff>While they are scholarly, don't expect to find Arcanists just hidden away in dusty towers. They hit the ground running, ready to explore every dungeon and ancient ruin in search of lore and knowledge that will increase their understanding on everything arcane - and thereby increase their personal power.</fluff>
	<fluff>The ancient traditions of the schools of wizardry have been handed down since the first began to dabble in arcane magic. What started as techniques and methods of training between masters and apprentices eventually become more institutionalized, and eventually actual academies of arcane study sprang up in the world and even among the eladrin of the Feywild.</fluff>
	<fluff>Today, where and how arcane magic is taught depends on where you happen to be. On the borderlands, in places such as Fallcrest, solitary mages pass on their knowledge to one or two apprenctives at a time. In larger settlements, such as the city of Nera, academies are dedicated to the training of wizards in all the schools of magic.</fluff>

		<name>Arcane Spellbook</name>
		<benefit>Where most arcane casters master a handful of spells, Arcanists collect spells in their spellbook to choose the right spell for each day.</benefit>
		<benefit>At first level, you add two 1st-level Wizard encounter attacks and two 1st-level Wizard daily attacks to your spellbook. When you finish an extended rest, you can prepare one Wizard encounter attack and one Wizard daily attack from your spellbook to use.</benefit>
		<benefit>You use the prepared powers normally until you prepare different spells. If you do not choose new powers at the end of an extended rest, such as if you don't have access to your spellbook, you retain the powers you previously prepared.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 2nd level, you add two 2nd-level Wizard utility powers to your spellbook, and can prepare one Wizard utility power when you finish an extended rest.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 3rd level, you add two 3rd-level Wizard encounter attacks to your spellbook, and can prepare two Wizard encounter attacks when you finish an extended rest, though only one of a given level.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 5th level, you add two 5th-level Wizard daily attacks to your spellbook, and can prepare two Wizard daily attacks when you finish an extended rest, though only one of a given level.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 7th level, you add two 7th-level Wizard encounter attacks to your spellbook and can prepare three Wizard encounter attacks when you finish an extended rest, though only one of a given level.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 9th level, you add two 9th-level Wizard daily attacks to your spellbook, and can prepare three Wizard daily attacks when you finish an extended rest, though only one of a given level.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 13th, 17th, 23rd and 27th level you add two Wizard encounter attacks of the given level to your spellbook without having to replace powers, though the number of Wizard encounter attacks you can prepare remains at three.</benefit>
		<benefit>At 15th, 19th, 25th, and 29th level you add two Wizard daily attacks of the given level to your spellbook without having to replace powers, though the number of Wizard daily attacks you can prepare remains at three.</benefit>
		<benefit>If you would normally replace a known power, such as from multiclassing, you can prepare one less Wizard power of the same kind and cannot prepare powers of the replaced level.</benefit>
		<benefit>An exception to the above is if you choose a Familiar feat that would require you to replace a power. Instead, you just add that power to your spellbook and can choose to prepare it in place of a Wizard power.</benefit>
