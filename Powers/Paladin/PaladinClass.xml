   <fluff>As a Paladin, you are an indomitable warrior who has pledged your prowess to something greater than yourself. You smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. As Paladin, you are transfigured on the field of battle, an exemplar of divine ethos in action.</fluff>
   <fluff>To a Champion is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. You refuse to allow temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.</fluff>
   <fluff>Champions following the edicts of evil gods are known as Blackguards among the common folk. While often more ruthless in their methods, they are no less devoted to their cause than the Champions of good.</fluff>

      <benefit>You gain the <![CDATA[<i>divine mettle</i> and <i>divine strength</i>]]> Channel Divinity powers.</benefit>
      <benefit>Feats and other abilities can grant you additional Channel Divinity powers. Unless the ability specifically says otherwise, you can still only use one Channel Divinity power in an encounter. If an ability allows you to regain the use of your Channel Divinity, you can use any Channel Divinity power you know, even the same one.</benefit>

      <name>Assassin Implement Powers</name>
      <benefit>The shadow magic wielded by Assassins is crude. But that also makes it easier to control. An Assassin does not necessarily need a specially prepared implement, instead harnessing magical power from a weapon.</benefit>
      <benefit>When you use an assassin Implement power, you can use any weapon you are proficient with as an implement.</benefit>
      <benefit>You do not count as having implement proficiency in the weapon for any other purposes.</benefit>

      <name>Optional Feature: Expert Poisoner</name>
      <benefit>Some Assassins learn to use shadow magic for alchemical shortcuts, allowing them to brew a limited amount of short-lived but potent poisons.</benefit>
      <benefit>You do not gain assassin daily attacks. Instead, you learn to create assassin poisons.</benefit>
      <benefit>At first level, you learn the recipes for two heroic-tier Assassin Poisons. When you finish an extended rest, you can prepare one vial of a heroic-tier Assassin Poison whose recipe you know.</benefit>
      <benefit>You must have a poisoner's kit to prepare Assassin Poisons. A prepared poison expires when you begin your next extended rest. You can apply only one Assassin Poison to an item. You are immune to an Assassin Poison you have prepared yourself, though not to the same poison prepared by a different Assassin.</benefit>
      <benefit>At fifth level, you learn the recipe for another heroic-tier Assassin Poison. When you finish an extended rest, you can now prepare two vials of heroic-tier Assassin Poisons whose recipe you know. You can prepare the same poison in multiple vials.</benefit>
      <benefit>At ninth level, you learn the recipe for another heroic-tier Assassin Poison. When you finish an extended rest, you can now prepare three vials of heroic-tier Assassin Poisons whose recipe you know.</benefit>
      <benefit>At fifteenth level, you learn the recipes for two paragon-tier Assassin Poisons. When you prepare your Assassin poisons, one of them can be paragon-tier.</benefit>
      <benefit>At nineteenth level, you learn the recipe for another paragon-tier Assassin Poison. When you prepare your Assassin Poisons, two of them can be paragon-tier.</benefit>
      <benefit>At twenty-fifth level, you learn the recipes for two epic-tier Assassin Poisons. When you prepare your Assassin Poisons, one of them can be epic-tier and the rest can be paragon-tier.</benefit>
      <benefit>At twenty-ninth level, you learn the recipe for another epic-tier Assassin Poison. When you prepare your Assassin Poisons, two of them can be epic-tier, and the last can be paragon-tier.</benefit>
