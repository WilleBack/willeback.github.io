   <fluff>As a Paladin, you are an indomitable warrior who has pledged your prowess to something greater than yourself. You smite enemies with divine authority, bolster the courage of nearby companions, and radiate as if a beacon of inextinguishable hope. As Paladin, you are transfigured on the field of battle, an exemplar of divine ethos in action.</fluff>
   <fluff>To a Champion is given the responsibility to unflinchingly stand before an enemy's charge, smiting them with your sword while protecting your allies with your sacrifice. Where others waver and wonder, your motivation is pure and simple, and your devotion is your strength. You refuse to allow temptation to dissuade you from your obligations.</fluff>
   <fluff>Champions following the edicts of evil gods are known as Blackguards among the common folk. While often more ruthless in their methods, they are no less devoted to their cause than the Champions of good.</fluff>

   <feature>
      <name>Channel Divinity</name>
      <benefit>You can invoke divine power, filling yourself with might derived from your cause. This power allows you to wield special powers.</benefit>
      <benefit>Once per encounter, you can use a Channel Divinity power.</benefit>
      <benefit>You gain the <![CDATA[<i>divine mettle</i> and <i>divine strength</i>]]> Channel Divinity powers.</benefit>
      <benefit>Feats and other abilities can grant you additional Channel Divinity powers. Unless the ability specifically says otherwise, you can still only use one Channel Divinity power in an encounter. If an ability allows you to regain the use of your Channel Divinity, you can use any Channel Divinity power you know, even the same one.</benefit>
