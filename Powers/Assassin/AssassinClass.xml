   <fluff>Few creatures embrace shadow magic without both a compelling reason and a measure of desperation. Not many visit the Shadowfell willingly, let alone pledge a shard of their souls to it. Yet that is exactly what Assassins, and other practitioners of shadow magic, do to gain their power.</fluff>
   <fluff>As an Assassin, you cede a portion of yourself to the Shadowfell, replacing a fundamental part of your being with a dark reflection of your true self. At times, you can manifest this twisted image in place of your body so that you can face attacks with little cause for concern. Also, the infusion of shadow magic allows you to spot the weakest points in a victim's defenses. With a few moments of study, you can reduce even the stoutest warrior to a corpse.</fluff>
   <fluff>An Assassin usually keeps his or her profession a secret, since few trust those who regularly deal in death. Assassins' guilds provide some measure of protection, especially in those regions where the study of shadow magic and assassination as an art form are banned.</fluff>
   <fluff>As a Stalker, you are an outcast. You traded away part of your soul for the power of death. Perhaps you seek justice against a powerful enemy, or maybe you had no other way to preserve yourself in the face of a bleak, uncaring world. Whatever drew you onto the Stalker's path, you are an avatar of death and a trained killer from whom few can escape unharmed.</fluff>
   
   <feature>
      <name>Assassin's Shroud</name>
      <benefit> The dark magic of the Shadowfell courses through your veins, tainting your soul but granting you the ability to subject an enemy to invisible shrouds that reveal its weakest points. The more of your shrouds there are on a target, the deadlier a blow you can strike against it.</benefit>
      <benefit>You gain the <![CDATA[<i>assassin's shroud</i>]]> class power that allows you to place your shrouds on a target. Other benefits can also allow you to place your shrouds on a target. You can have your shrouds on only one creature, and one creature can have up to four of your shrouds on it. A creature can have shrouds from multiple assassins on it.</benefit>
      <benefit>If a creature is not aware of your presence, it is not aware of your shrouds being on it either.</benefit>
      <benefit>Before you make an attack roll against the target, you choose to invoke either all your shrouds on it or none of them. If you invoke your shrouds and the attack hits, the attack deals +1d6 damage for each shroud. If the attack misses, you deal damage for one less shroud, even if the attack normally deals half or no damage on a miss. After the attack has been resolved, all your shrouds vanish from the target.</benefit>
      <benefit>The damage per shroud increases to 1d8 + 2 at 11th level, and to 1d10 + 4 at 21st level.</benefit>

   <feature>
      <name>Guild Training</name>
      <benefit>Assassins gain their abilities by following a training regimen developed by a particular guild. Even an assassin taught by an individual master studies a set of teachings that were once developed by a guild.</benefit>
      <benefit>Choose either Bleak Disciple, Martial Executioner, or Night Stalker as your method of training.</benefit>
      
      <subfeature>
         <name>Bleak Disciple</name>
         <benefit>The tradition of the Bleak Disciple teaches its adherents to forge the stuff of shadow into a weapon they can use against their foes. Its strictest followers keep a white cloth that they dab in the blood of each slain foe, and before they attack a chosen target, they reflect on this memento of the foes they have defeated.</benefit>
         <benefit>Against a nonbloodied target, you deal additional damage equal to your number of shrouds on the target. If the target is at full hit points or it has been bloodied but regained hit points to become unbloodied, you add your Constitution modifier to this damage.</benefit>
         <benefit>This damage increases to 2 per shroud at 11th level, and to 3 per shroud at 21st level. Also at 21st level, you add twice your Constitution modifier to the damage instead of once, when applicable.</benefit>
         <benefit>Also, whenever you kill a creature with a shadow power, you gain a bonus to the first assassin Implement damage roll you make before the end of your next turn. This bonus equals your Constitution modifier, and increases to 4 + your Constitution modifier at 11th level, and to 8 + your Constitution modifier at 21st level.</benefit>
